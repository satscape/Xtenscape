Xtenscape is a java application to control X-10 Home automation devices. It is no longer under development.

Xtenscape-for-iPhone (this stuff) is open source and can be found here. The app was originally on the Apple App store, but I withdrew 
it as I don't really like iPhone developing, and didn't want to pay apple $99 per year for writing apps for their 
devices :-)

I'm offering the source code for this Xtenscape client app to anyone who wants to play with it and develop their own 
client apps. I've got no problem with you writing iPhone apps using this source code and even publishing to the apple 
app store yourself. If your published app is not free, I'd appreciate a small one-off donation, you can find a donate 
button on my web site. This is purely optional and up to you.

It's been a while since I looked at the source code, but its pretty simple. the app connects to a kind of fake web 
server on the desktop application and sends it commands to get a list of appliances and turn a specific device on and 
off. A little crude and could probably be made better. One thing to bear in mind, I cannot change how xtenscape 
desktop's fake web server works (protocol etc) as that would probably break people who are still using the existing 
Xtenscape for iPhone app (like me).

Finally, I'm not playing with this source code any more, I'm simply publishing it here for you to do whatever you want 
with it. I'll try to answer any questions you have, but basically heres the source code, you're on you're own. Have fun!


Cheers,
Scott Hather
